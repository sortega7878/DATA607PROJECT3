## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
app_name <- "CUNYa pp"
consumer_key <- "86f4rk3216exuc"
consumer_secret <- "eVQnzHbR1CFxIh1y"

#Using OAuth for connection with linkedin

in.auth <- inOAuth(app_name, consumer_key, consumer_secret)

#bringing down connections from my personal profile



my.connections <- getProfile(in.auth)

text <- toString(my.connections$industry)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
